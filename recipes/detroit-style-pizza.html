    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Who doesn't love pizza?!</p>
    <p>
      This recipe makes an indulgent Detroit style pizza. Detroit style pizza is
      rectangular in shape with a thick crust. It is usually made with sauce,
      pepperoni, and tons of cheese, that bakes all the way to the edges. This
      gives the pizza that distinct and amazing crunch.
    </p>
    <p>
      To help save time, this pizza is made with sore-bought pizza dough (Trader
      Joes for the win!) but you can always make your own.
    </p>
    <p>
      Feel free to change up the toppings for this recipe! It is traditionally
      made with pepperoni, but you can use a vegan substitute or omit it
      completely if you would like.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil</li>
      <li>1 pound store-bought or homemade pizza dough</li>
      <li>4 cloves garlic, grated</li>
      <li>1/4 cup fresh basil, chopped</li>
      <li>1/4 cup fresh orageno, chopped</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon crushed fennel seed</li>
      <li>chili flakes</li>
      <li>kosher salt and black pepper</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons pepperonchini, chopped</li>
      <li>2 cups marinara sauce (I use Trader Joes canned marinara sauce)</li>
      <li>1 cup cherry tomatoes</li>
      <li>1 1/2 cups cubed brick cheese or whole milk mozzarella</li>
      <li>1/2 cup cubed provolone cheese</li>
      <li>1/2 cup cubed cheddar cheese</li>
      <li>8 ounces pepperoni, sliced (optional)</li>
      <li>honey, for serving</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Position an oven rack in the bottom half of the oven. Preheat the oven
        to 500° F.
      </li>
      <li>
        Drizzle the olive oil in 9×13 metal cake pan (or a Detroit-style pizza
        pan). Put the pizza dough in the pan and gently stretch it out to fit so
        the dough almost reaches the corners. Cover with plastic wrap and let
        sit 30 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, in a bowl, combine the garlic, basil, oregano, fennel, and a
        pinch each of chili flakes, salt, and pepper.
      </li>
      <li>
        To assemble. Gently press the dough until it covers the entire pan.
        Layer on half of the pepperoni slices (if using), then the pepperoncini.
        Spoon on the tomato sauce. Sprinkle over half of the herbs. Top with
        cheese, then tomatoes, then the remaining herbs, and more
        pepperoni(again, if using).
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake until bubbly and a crispy cheese crust has formed, 10 to 15
        minutes. Using a spatula, loosen the edges and slide on to a cutting
        board. Slice into squares and serve with fresh basil and honey.
      </li>
    </ol>
