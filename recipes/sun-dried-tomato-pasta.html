    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Sometimes, you need a one pot recipe. One pot, one thing to clean. That's
      my favoite kind of meal to prepare.
    </p>
    <p>
      This recipe is comforting, easy, perfect for a weeknight meal. Who doesn't
      want a big bowl of pasta after a long day?
    </p>
    <p>
      I also like to serve this recipe with a big salad with arugula...and a
      glass of wine.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 jar (8 ounce) oil-packed sun-dried tomatoes</li>
      <li>2 small shallots, sliced</li>
      <li>4 cloves garlic, chopped</li>
      <li>1 1/2 teaspoon spanish or smoked paprika</li>
      <li>red pepper flakes</li>
      <li>kosher salt and black pepper</li>
      <li>1 pound short cut pasta (I used penne)</li>
      <li>1 cup whole milk ricotta cheese</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons lemon juice (fresh)</li>
      <li>1 cup grated parmesan cheese</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons salted butter</li>
      <li>1/3 cup chopped fresh basil</li>
      <li>1/3 cup chopped fresh parsley</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh dill (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Drain the oil from the sun-dried tomato jar into a large pot or skillet
        with sides. Chop the sun-dried tomatoes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Set the pot over medium-high heat. Add the shallots and garlic, cook
        until fragrant, 2 minutes. Stir in the sun-dried tomatoes, paprika, and
        a pinch each of red pepper flakes, salt, and pepper. Cook until the
        tomatoes turn deep red and are crisping, 3-5 minutes. Add 3 1/2 cups
        water. Bring to a boil, add the pasta, and cook, stirring often, until
        the pasta is al dente, 8 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, whip the ricotta and lemon in a food processor until creamy.
        Season with salt.
      </li>
      <li>
        To the pasta, stir in in the parmesan and butter until very creamy.
        Remove from the heat and stir in the basil, parsley, and dill (if
        using).
      </li>
      <li>
        Swirl the ricotta into a large pasta bowl or individual bowls. Add the
        hot pasta and lightly toss with the ricotta. Top each bowl with
        additional herbs and parmesan.
      </li>
    </ol>
